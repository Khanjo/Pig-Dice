    <h1>PIG DICE</h1>
    <p>Pig is a dice game in which players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll
        results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.</p>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
    <ul>
        <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
        <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
        <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's
            turn.</li>
    </ul>
    The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
